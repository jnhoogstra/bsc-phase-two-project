# Phase Two Project Repo
**Authors:** Elliott Iturbe, Colette Crowder, Will Toranto

## Overview
The goal of this project is to discover how to make the most profitable movie possible in order to make business recommendations to Microsoft. Descriptive analyses of a variety of data on previously released movies reveal that the most profitable movie Microsoft could make is an adventure movie with an NR rating, directed by Jean Negulsesco at Buena Vistas studios, with a runtime between 100 minutes and 131 minutes.

## Business Problem
Microsoft wants to open a movie studio that can compete with other successful movie studios. However, they lack knowledge about filmmaking. To help them in this area, we will find out how a variety of factors affect the popularity of movies and then offer recommendations.

## Data
We examined data on gross, genre, studio, director, release date, MPR rating, Rotten Tomatoes score, and run time. Variables like gross and Rotten Tomatoes score served as measures of the success of movies. The relationship between the rest of the variables and those two measures of success demonstrate what factors can be relied upon to make a profitable movie.

## Methods
Our process started with organizing our data by dropping irrelevant columns, creating new ones, sorting by specific values, and merging dataframes. While modeling our data, we used descriptive statistics to create helpful visuals that displayed our findings. Overall, our descriptive analysis is absolutely essential for anyone who wants to succeed in the movie industry.

## Results

This visualization shows which genre of movie Microsoft should make based on which genre has the highest worldwide gross.

This is a visual of how Rotten Tomatoes user-generated ratings vary according to different MPAA ratings of adventure movies.

This graph shows the most profitable directors for adventure movies. We conclude that Jean Negulesco is by far the best choice.

Buena Vistas Studios ("BV") is responsible 65% of the top 20 grossing movies. If Microsoft is interested in using another studio to make their film, they should contact Buena Vistas.

This is a comparison of runtime to revenue that reveals there is no true monetary value for creating a movie with a runtime outside of the shaded area.

This graph shows the average rating of movies according to month of release. Because there is no significant difference between each month, we conclude release month doesn't really matter.

## Conclusions
We recommend that Microsoft uses Buena Vistas studios or models their own studio after BV practices and creates an adventure movie with an NR rating. They should also hire Jean Negulseso. The run time of the movie should be between 100 minutes and 131 minutes. Microsoft should not put time and money into securing any particular release month.

## Next Steps
This project did not explore all possible avenues of increasing movie profitability. In the future, analyses could be performed regarding the actors who Microsoft should hire, what kind of storylines are received best by audiences, and what aspects of a movie trailer cause people to develop interest in seeing a movie. Additionally, it could benefit Microsoft to learn about the state of the film industry after COVID-19, which shut down theatres for a long period of time and may have impacted audience interest in ways that are not known yet.
